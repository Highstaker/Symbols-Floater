## Usage
An applet is created on top of your window.

To open the floater dialog, either open the menu and click `Toggle Floater`, or scroll mouse wheel over the icon or press it with middle mouse button.

To add a page, click `Add Page` and enter its name.
To delete a page, press "X" button on its tab.
To add symbols, press `Add Symbols` and enter all the symbols you want on this page. They will appear in separate buttons on the page.

When you click a button, the symbol is copied to clipboard. You can paste it to your window. The Floater's window is not focused on when you click it, so you don't need to click your text editor's window again.
